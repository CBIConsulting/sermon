ServiceFail object could alse receive full service info and data engine. Doing so
ServiceFail object would create database entries. And Sermon_app doesn't have
to do so many things.

*******

All DB IDs MUST be uint64_t (some are int and long int)

*******

Make it possible to enable/disable outage and response time logs.

*******

ServiceFail->send() could be called from another thread. So, while e-mails and notifications
are being sent, we can carry on checking services. Everything should be copied to another class,
because the object may be destroyed while sending e-mails and can cause corruption.

*******

Emails delayed notifications. Wait a few seconds before sending e-mail notifications. Sometimes,
some services may fail at the same time and we can send just one mail instead of N mails.
